# ParkScout-Smart-Parking-System
**Real-time Parking Detection using Raspberry Pi 4, OpenCV, and Python**

> Say goodbye to circling the block. ParkScout helps drivers find available parking faster, saving time, fuel, and stress.

## 📸 Project Overview

ParkScout is a prototype smart parking detection system built using **Raspberry Pi 4** and a **5MP AGP Camera Module**. The concept is demonstrated using **Hot Wheels cars** on a scaled-down parking lot model.

### 🔍 Problem

In congested urban areas without designated pay parking, drivers waste significant time and petrol circling the streets in search of a spot. This leads to:

- Increased traffic congestion  
- Driver frustration  
- Missed parking opportunities  
- Unnecessary fuel consumption

### 💡 Solution

ParkScout detects available parking spots in **real-time** using computer vision and shares this info with users, helping reduce fuel waste, stress, and traffic.
